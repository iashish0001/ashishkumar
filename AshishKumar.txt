Question 2 - Pseudo code

1. we will have two loops onr for loop and inside the for loop there is a while loop.
2. In the for loop we will iterate over the characters and in the while loop we will count the frequency of the character.
For I in range str.length {
    while str[i] != str[j] 
           j++
    Result = str[i] + j
3. we will appened a string to kep track of the compressed string.
4. We could have used hash map if it were a sorted string.
3.we dont have to iterate the entire string again and again. we can simply check by i+j and i-j, to get the last index to continue counting.
5.EX input = aaabbbbcccaaaaa
output = a3b3c3a5

Decompress
1. we will have two variables which will keep track of the char and the integer respectively.
2. inside the for loop we will print the char according to the frequency.
